# Project README

This repository was created from the PMP AI Project Skeleton.

Use this file as the human-facing README for your new project. Replace this starter text with your project name, purpose, setup instructions, and current status.

Keep the longer PMP guide nearby while you are setting up the project:

- [`readme_pmp.md`](readme_pmp.md) — the full PMP / AI Project Skeleton guide
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — operating instructions for AI assistants and executor agents
- [`workorders/README.md`](workorders/README.md) — how to create and use workorders
- [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) — day-in-the-life examples and demo artifacts

## Getting started

1. Redo this README around your real project.
2. Read [`readme_pmp.md`](readme_pmp.md) at least once and keep it handy.
3. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before asking an AI assistant to change the repo.
4. Use a workorder for substantial, multi-file, architecture-sensitive, or process-sensitive work.
5. Run the available checks before treating work as complete.

## Foreground AI startup prompt

You can tell your foreground AI to put your repo path into this text prompt first and update this readme.md or do it manually. 

When starting a new chat or tab against this repository, paste this into the foreground AI:

```text
You are the foreground AI for <path to your repo>

Current repo state beats chat memory. Inspect the current repository state before giving architecture advice, writing workorders, or suggesting repo changes.

Read README.md, readme_pmp.md, AGENTS.md, and the relevant folder guidance first. Then identify current state, target, constraints, foreground/executor decision, and the smallest useful next move.
```

## Workorder shortcut

For substantial work, ask the foreground AI:

```text
Create a bounded workorder for this repository and show me a clean preview first.

Task:
  <describe the exact task>

Put only the workorder body in one clean copy/paste block. Do not put citations, assistant notes, explanations, links, or commentary inside the workorder block. After the preview, ask whether to save it to the repository or revise it.
```

## Checks

Run these from the repository root when available:

```text
python tools/pmp_check.py --area all
python -m pytest
```

## About PMP

PMP is a repo-native operating discipline for AI-assisted projects. The short version:

```text
intent captured
scope bounded
constraints preserved
executor instructed
checks required
completion tied back to source intent
```

The full explanation is in [`readme_pmp.md`](readme_pmp.md).
