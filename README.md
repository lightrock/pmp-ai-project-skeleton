# Doctor Bones

Doctor Bones is a vendor-independent repository template for AI-assisted development.

It helps you keep project memory inside the repo instead of trapped in chat. It gives your human/AI team a shared operating discipline: workorders, playbooks, examples, checks, handoff rules, and release-readiness habits.

The idea is, whenever you start a new project, start with a Doctor Bones.

You do not necessarily have to check out the template copy of your repository to use it. Doctor Bones carries its cognitionkitecture in the repository itself. If you follow the startup instructions below, your foreground AI should have enough project smarts to reason from the repo guidance, examples, playbooks, checks, and handoff rules.

By default, nothing has to "run" anywhere in the traditional way, and you do not necessarily have to invoke an executor such as Codex. Point your foreground AI at the appropriate Doctor Bones-based repository instance first. Use an executor only when the task needs file edits, a runtime environment, checks, commits, or pull requests.

## What this is

Doctor Bones is not another coding agent.

It is a repo-native discipline layer for using AI assistants and coding agents without losing intent, constraints, checks, or project history.

The basic model is:

```text
human intent
→ foreground AI clarifies the task
→ repo captures durable guidance
→ executor AI performs bounded work
→ checks verify what can be verified
→ completion ties back to source intent
```

Think of the foreground AI as the planning and architecture assistant. Think of the executor AI as the worker with file access, a runtime environment, tests, and commit/PR tools.

The repo is the memory and discipline layer between them.

## Getting started

1. If you copied this template, rewrite this README around your real project soon.
2. Read [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) to see the day-in-the-life workflow examples.
3. Read [`readme_pmp.md`](readme_pmp.md) at least once and keep it handy.
4. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before asking an AI assistant to change the repo.
5. Use a workorder for substantial, multi-file, architecture-sensitive, or process-sensitive work.
6. Run the available checks before treating work as complete.

## Foreground AI startup prompt

This prompt is for a repository created from the Doctor Bones template. After copying this template, replace `<your project repository URL>` with your own project repository URL.

When starting a new chat or tab for your project repository, paste this into the foreground AI:

```text
You are the foreground AI for <your project repository URL>.

Current repo state beats chat memory. Inspect the current project repository before giving
architecture advice, writing workorders, or suggesting repo changes.

Read README.md, examples/README.md, readme_pmp.md, AGENTS.md, and the relevant folder
guidance from the project repository first. Then identify current state, target, constraints,
foreground/executor decision, and the smallest useful next move.
```

## Workorder shortcut

For substantial work in your copied project repository, talk with the foreground AI until the task is clear, then say:

```text
Create a workorder and also show it to me here.
```

You can copy a link to the workorder file and tell your executor AI, working in an environment for your project repository, to perform it.

You can also copy/paste the workorder body if you asked the foreground AI to show it first. Keep that copy/paste block clean: no citations, assistant notes, explanations, extra links, or commentary inside the workorder body.

## Checks

Run these from the repository root when available:

```text
python tools/pmp_check.py --area all
python -m pytest
```

If a check fails, paste the exact command output into the foreground AI and ask for the smallest safe fix.
