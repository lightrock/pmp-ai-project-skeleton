# PMP AI Project Skeleton

AI-vendor-agnostic project memory for AI-assisted development.

This repository is a GitHub template for projects that need more than prompts, chats, and generated code.

It gives humans and AI systems a shared project memory: workorders, intent records, architecture cognition, break words, full gates, examples, and repo-grounded operating discipline.

The point is simple:

```text
Do not keep the real project living only in chat.
Put the project memory in the repository.
```

## Use this template

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub.
2. Create a new repository for your project.
3. Treat that new repository as the durable project memory for the work.
4. Read `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the `workorders/` guidance in the new project.
5. Use workorders for substantial or process-sensitive tasks.

The template path is the clean first path. Future versions may support cleaner ways to splice this pattern into existing repositories.

## What this is

PMP is a project-management skeleton for AI-assisted work.

It is not an app framework.

It is not a deployment scaffold.

It is not a vendor-specific prompt pack.

It is a repository pattern for making AI-assisted projects more durable, inspectable, and less stupid.

The repository becomes the shared operating substrate. A human may use ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, Claude, Gemini, local models, contractor tooling, or future AI systems, but the project memory, workorders, intent records, checks, and architecture doctrine should live in the repo instead of being trapped inside one vendor's chat window.

## Core idea

Human-readable documentation still matters.

But for AI-assisted projects, human docs are no longer enough.

AI-readable architecture cognition becomes the operating substrate.

Human-facing documentation becomes a view, explanation, and audit artifact generated from that substrate.

Humans remain in authority.

The repo helps the AI know what it is doing before it generates, connects, exposes, modifies, or merges anything.

## Foreground AI quickstart

A foreground AI is the planning and intent-capture assistant.

An executor AI is the implementation assistant.

For example: a human may talk to a foreground AI to clarify intent and create a workorder, then hand that workorder to an executor AI to perform the bounded change.

Before substantial work, paste this into your foreground AI chat:

```text
You are the foreground AI for this PMP-style repository.

Your job is not to produce word salad.

Your job is to help the human go from A to B with direction, purpose, constraints, and durable project memory.

Before doing substantial work:
1. Inspect the current repository state.
2. Read README.md and AGENTS.md.
3. Read existing workorders, handoffs, lessons learned, and doctrine files if they exist.
4. Treat current repo state as stronger than chat memory.
5. Identify the lane: doctrine, proposal concept, implementation, workorder, demo artifact, README/docs, architecture correction, release/stabilization, or conflict resolution.
6. Identify the current base: file path, pasted text, commit, screenshot, behavior, issue, PR, or workorder.
7. Identify the target: what B should look like.
8. Identify constraints: what must not be implied, broken, expanded, or silently changed.
9. Produce the smallest useful concrete output.

Default response shape:
Current state:
  A

Target:
  B

Constraint:
  Do not imply/break/expand C

Next move:
  patch/create/commit/workorder D
```

## Core concepts

### Workorders

A workorder is a durable task contract.

It is not a chat transcript.

It explains what the next human, AI assistant, coding agent, or review process is supposed to do.

Use workorders when intent matters as much as the diff.

See [`workorders/README.md`](workorders/README.md) and [`workorders/TEMPLATE.md`](workorders/TEMPLATE.md).

### AGENTS.md

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) contains direct operating instructions for AI assistants and executor agents.

It is the machine-facing discipline layer.

The README is the human landing page.

### Break words

Break words are caution lights.

They are terms like `agent`, `automation`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `policy`, `profile`, `full gate`, `safe`, `secure`, `command`, `control`, and `production-ready`.

They are not banned words. They are words that should make humans and AI assistants slow down before they accidentally create the wrong architecture.

### Full gates

A full gate is the full battery of project checks.

It is not one magic test.

A mature project may codify lite, focused, and full checks over contracts, schemas, generated files, workorder references, intent preservation, examples, docs, policy boundaries, release assumptions, and related project rules.

### Conflict by intent

A pull request is not only a diff.

A merge conflict is not only a text collision.

In a PMP-style repository, conflicts should be interpreted through recorded intent. If two branches conflict, inspect the workorders and ask what each change was trying to accomplish before choosing text mechanically.

### Architecture-first folders

This skeleton is not trying to make every project look like a legacy MVC app, a generic CRUD app, or a framework demo.

Project folder hierarchy should reflect the semantics of the project.

Folders are part of the cognition layer. They tell humans and AI assistants what kinds of things exist, what distinctions matter, and what should not be collapsed.

We are architectures first, not "look mom, I made an app" UI CRUD type things.

See [`docs/architecture/semantic-folder-hierarchy.md`](docs/architecture/semantic-folder-hierarchy.md).

## Examples

See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md).

The examples show what you can do when your AI has cognition-first context about your projects.

They are not claims that a finished system exists.

They are communication artifacts showing how project memory, architecture cognition, constraints, roles, intent, and concrete artifacts can work together.

## Origin trail

The original long-form, feral README capture is preserved at:

[`docs/origin/stream-of-consciousness.md`](docs/origin/stream-of-consciousness.md)

That file preserves the manifesto language and first-pass project-manager AI framing. It is intentionally raw.

## Why we did this

Two core projects we are working on are highly AI-disciplined complex architectures:

- Polycentric Federated Evidence Mesh
- Polycentric Federated Command Mesh

Those particular projects may not be suitable for everyone.

But the project-management and architecture-cognition problem for AI systems is much broader than those projects.

AI-assisted development needs durable project memory, intent records, workorders, break words, full gates, and a way for humans and AI systems to share enough structure that the AI can act with confidence instead of guessing from vibes.

This first public skeleton is shared so other people can use it, fork it, simplify it, harden it, argue with it, and adapt it for their own AI-assisted project workflows.

## Status

`v0.1.0` is the first public skeleton.

It is usable, but not finished.

Expect the repo to evolve from captured doctrine toward cleaner docs, check runners, examples, and workflow tooling.
