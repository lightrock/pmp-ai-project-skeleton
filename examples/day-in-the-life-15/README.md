# Day in the life 15: make your foreground AI smarter with reference repos

This example is about giving a foreground AI focused architecture context before it writes advice, plans, or repo changes.

The point is simple:

```text
Load relevant reference repositories on purpose.
Keep the current repo boundary clear.
Say what you actually read.
```

## Human request

```text
Before you give architecture advice for this repo, load up on the following reference repositories.
```

Example reference repositories:

- `lightrock/PFEM`
- `lightrock/PFCOMM`

These are examples. A different project may name different reference repositories.

A reference repo can be:

- an architecture repo
- a method library
- a playbook collection
- a standards/example repo
- a prior project with reusable patterns
- another person's repo being analyzed for architecture lessons or issue suggestions

For example, a repository like `skills-for-humanity` could be loaded as a method-library reference repo. The foreground AI should inspect it, identify portable reasoning procedures, and use them only when the human asks to port, adapt, compare, or load up on that source.

Another example is [`ZhixiangLuo/10xProductivity`](https://github.com/ZhixiangLuo/10xProductivity), which can be loaded as a workflow-pattern reference repo for local-agent-as-universal-client, tool-connection recipes, and cross-tool productivity workflows. The foreground AI should treat it as reference material, not automatic DrBones doctrine.

A premier example of intelligent reference-repo analysis is [`bawbel/scanner`](https://github.com/bawbel/scanner). The foreground AI can inspect that repo against a current-repo architecture lens such as PFEM, compare evidence boundaries, contracts, schemas, testing discipline, runtime/static separation, confidence versus severity, lifecycle handling, and output contracts, then produce respectful GitHub issue suggestions. The point is not to criticize another repo from memory; the point is to read the source, identify what it already does well, name the real architectural gap if one exists, and preserve the boundary between source-backed observation and inference.

## PFEM-lite fallback

Doctor Bones carries a small embedded PFEM reference at:

```text
docs/internal-reference/pfem-lite.md
```

Use PFEM-lite when the human asks for a PFEM-style first-pass analysis and the live `lightrock/PFEM` repo is not being inspected.

PFEM-lite is enough to support a useful analysis of:

- evidence boundaries
- provenance
- normalization
- confidence
- MCP/tool authority boundaries
- findings, reports, packages, rollups, and proof discipline
- workorders and checks as durable project discipline

Do not overclaim it.

Use this wording when appropriate:

```text
I used Doctor Bones' embedded PFEM-lite reference for this analysis.
I did not inspect the full live PFEM repository.
```

If the human asks for a full PFEM comparison, inspect current `lightrock/PFEM` files and report which PFEM files were actually read.

## Source roles

Current repo:

- The repository being changed or advised on.
- Owns its own workorders, playbooks, examples, checks, handoff rules, and current repo state.

Reference repo example: PFEM

- PFEM is an evidence architecture source.
- It may be useful for evidence boundaries, provenance, normalization, findings, reports, packages, rollups, and proof discipline.
- The embedded PFEM-lite reference is a first-pass lens, not a substitute for a full live PFEM repo scan.

Reference repo example: PFCOMM

- PFCOMM is a communication architecture source.
- It may be useful for requests, status, handoffs, approvals, coordination, and human-AI communication boundaries.

Reference repo example: method library

- A method-library repo is a source of reusable procedures.
- It may be useful for extracting named reasoning workflows, routing patterns, checklists, or playbook candidates.
- It should not be copied wholesale. The foreground AI should classify what is portable, what is vendor-specific, and what belongs only in the reference repo.

Reference repo example: workflow-pattern repo

- A workflow-pattern repo is a source of reusable operating patterns, setup flows, tool-connection recipes, or automation examples.
- It may be useful for comparing how another project structures agent-readable playbooks, local setup, tool connections, and cross-tool workflows.
- It should not be treated as permission to copy security assumptions, credentials flows, automation claims, or product positioning into the current repo.

Reference repo example: external architecture analysis

- An external repo can be analyzed to learn architecture lessons or draft useful issue suggestions.
- The foreground AI should read actual files from the external repo before making claims.
- The foreground AI should separate what the external repo already does well from what appears to be missing.
- The foreground AI should label source-backed observations separately from architectural inference.
- The output should be respectful, concrete, and useful to the external maintainer.

## Checklist

Before writing advice based on reference repositories, the foreground AI should answer:

- Which current-repo files were read?
- Which reference repositories were named by the human?
- Which reference files were read?
- Was `docs/internal-reference/pfem-lite.md` used instead of live PFEM inspection?
- What transfers cleanly into the current repo?
- What belongs only in a reference repo?
- What is source-backed?
- What is inference?
- What should the current repo do next, if anything?

## Practical lesson

A smarter foreground AI is not just a longer prompt.

It is a source-aware setup:

- current repo first
- selected reference repos second
- embedded fallback references only when clearly named
- clear transfer rules
- bounded next action

Load more context. Keep sharper boundaries. Say what you actually read.
