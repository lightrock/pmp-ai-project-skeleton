# Examples

This folder contains small examples of what becomes possible when an AI assistant has architecture cognition instead of only prompt context.

Each example gets its own subfolder.

The examples are intentionally simple and easy to inspect. They are communication artifacts, not claims of finished products.

Each example listed is linked to the AI repo guidance so that it will do what it says it does if a prompt matches the same intent. There is a python test for that. If you add a new one of these, the test will fail and the repo guidance will need an update. Tell your foreground agent to fix it if it wasn't automatic.

## Current examples

- [`day-in-the-life-1/`](day-in-the-life-1/README.md) — a normal PMP-style workflow: a human asks for repo guidance changes, the foreground AI creates a bounded workorder, the coding agent executes the task, checks run, and the completion note ties the work back to the task contract.
- [`day-in-the-life-2/`](day-in-the-life-2/README.md) — a repo-identity workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to make startup instructions and workorder handoffs explicitly name the current repository so new chats and coding agents do not guess the wrong repo.
- [`day-in-the-life-3/`](day-in-the-life-3/README.md) — an architecture-doctrine migration workflow: a human changes the governing architecture principles, so the foreground AI creates a workorder to update AI guidance, folder semantics, examples, checks, and tests instead of casually patching prose.
- [`day-in-the-life-4/`](day-in-the-life-4/README.md) — a distributed-guidance workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to keep root AGENTS.md global and move folder-specific AI guidance into appropriate folder-level AGENTS.md and README.md files.
- [`day-in-the-life-5/`](day-in-the-life-5/README.md) — a vendor-adapter workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to create a workorder for reading vendor API docs and building an adapter from a template with normalization, samples, non-live behavior, and tests.
- [`day-in-the-life-6/`](day-in-the-life-6/README.md) — a release-surface workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to map versions, notes, metadata, artifacts, deployment steps, checks, and manual final gates before automating release work.
- [`day-in-the-life-7/`](day-in-the-life-7/README.md) — an invocable vigilance-check workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to inspect boring-but-important change sources, classify signals, and open issues or workorders only when evidence justifies action.
- [`day-in-the-life-8/`](day-in-the-life-8/README.md) — an invocable contradiction-scan workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to compare claims across docs, workorders, examples, issues, schemas, tests, and implementation without confusing stale references for current authority.
- [`day-in-the-life-9/`](day-in-the-life-9/README.md) — an invocable project-wiki-build workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to turn scattered context into durable, auditable wiki pages while preserving source links, authority levels, and uncertainty.
- [`day-in-the-life-10/`](day-in-the-life-10/README.md) — an invocable project-knowledge-bank workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to collect reusable examples, phrases, boundaries, workorder patterns, and do-not-say rules so future AI work draws from source-backed material.
- [`day-in-the-life-11/`](day-in-the-life-11/README.md) — a vendor-independent playbook packaging workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to convert a proven invocable workflow into a repo-owned playbook that any AI vendor or human can follow.
- [`day-in-the-life-12/`](day-in-the-life-12/README.md) — an MCP-style tool-agent design workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to design tool access with explicit roles, tool contracts, approval gates, proof paths, and PFEM/PFCOMM-style authority boundaries before exposing tools to an AI assistant.
- [`day-in-the-life-13/`](day-in-the-life-13/README.md) — an outside-agent-pattern workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to steal the reusable pattern from an external agent idea without copying the product, hype, unsafe assumptions, or bad authority boundaries.
- [`day-in-the-life-14/`](day-in-the-life-14/README.md) — a release-readiness stabilization workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to stop adding new doctrine and check whether docs, examples, playbooks, wiki pages, checks, and authority boundaries still hang together before tagging a release.
- [`day-in-the-life-15/`](day-in-the-life-15/README.md) — a reference-repo context workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to load selected reference repositories into context while preserving current-repo authority and avoiding context soup.
- [`day-in-the-life-16/`](day-in-the-life-16/README.md) — a human-correction workflow: a human correction reveals missing repo memory, so the foreground AI decides whether to patch a durable rule where future AI assistants will actually read it.
- [`day-in-the-life-17/`](day-in-the-life-17/README.md) — a failed-test repair loop: a human pastes exact failed check output, and the foreground AI classifies the failure, fixes the smallest real cause, reruns the same check, and reports the result.
- [`day-in-the-life-18/`](day-in-the-life-18/README.md) — an external-workflow-output repair workflow: a human brings output from n8n, Zapier, Make, MCP tools, RAG systems, or agent workflows, and the foreground AI separates evidence, inference, decision, command, execution, proof, and report before trusting or importing it.
- [`webgl-demo-3/`](webgl-demo-3/README.md) — a WebGL architecture-cognition demo. This demonstrates the cognition approach to disciplined Human-AI cognition framework, this referenced the PFEM/PFCOMM highly disciplined architectures and automatically knew what to do for a demo based on the cognition and a simple prompt "go make me a webgl demo that shows..."
- [`hobbyist-mechanic-57-chevy/`](hobbyist-mechanic-57-chevy/README.md) — a WebGL concept demo for a hobbyist mechanic restoring a 1957 Chevy while tracking parts, work, decisions, and next actions. It followed the previous example and showed the agents working to resolve restoration project actions. If it can make a 3D demo of what is going on, it can generate a typical old-school CRUD workflow... correctly...
