# Examples

This folder contains small examples of what becomes possible when an AI assistant has architecture cognition instead of only prompt context.

Each example gets its own subfolder.

The examples are intentionally simple and easy to inspect. They are communication artifacts, not claims of finished products.

## Current examples

- [`day-in-the-life-1/`](day-in-the-life-1/README.md) — a normal PMP-style workflow: a human asks for repo guidance changes, the foreground AI creates a bounded workorder, the coding agent executes the task, checks run, and the completion note ties the work back to the task contract.
- [`day-in-the-life-2/`](day-in-the-life-2/README.md) — a repo-identity workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to make startup instructions and workorder handoffs explicitly name the current repository so new chats and coding agents do not guess the wrong repo.
- [`day-in-the-life-3/`](day-in-the-life-3/README.md) — an architecture-doctrine migration workflow: a human changes the governing architecture principles, so the foreground AI creates a workorder to update AI guidance, folder semantics, examples, checks, and tests instead of casually patching prose.
- [`day-in-the-life-4/`](day-in-the-life-4/README.md) — a distributed-guidance workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to keep root AGENTS.md global and move folder-specific AI guidance into appropriate folder-level AGENTS.md and README.md files.
- [`day-in-the-life-5/`](day-in-the-life-5/README.md) — a vendor-adapter workflow: a human asks the foreground AI to create a workorder for reading vendor API docs and building an adapter from a template with normalization, samples, non-live behavior, and tests.
- [`webgl-demo-3/`](webgl-demo-3/README.md) — a WebGL architecture-cognition demo. This demonstrates the cognition approach to disciplined Human-AI cognition framework, this referenced the PFEM/PFCOMM highly disciplined architectures and automatically knew what to do for a demo based on the cognition and a simple prompt "go make me a webgl demo that shows..."
- [`hobbyist-mechanic-57-chevy/`](hobbyist-mechanic-57-chevy/README.md) — a WebGL concept demo for a hobbyist mechanic restoring a 1957 Chevy while tracking parts, work, decisions, and next actions. It followed the previous example and showed the agents working to resolve restoration project actions. If it can make a 3D demo of what is going on, it can generate a typical old-school CRUD workflow... correctly...
